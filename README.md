# Project Title
House Price Prediction
## Problem
Housing prices can be hard to estimate because many factors affect them.
The goal of this project was to predict house prices based on features like size, number of bedrooms, and age.

## Solution
I used a dataset of house information and trained a simple machine learning model to find patterns between house features and price.
The model learns from past examples and makes predictions for new houses.

## Tools
Python

Google Sheets (for data cleaning)

CSV files

Scikit-learn

## Results
The model was able to predict reasonable house prices based on the input data.
I also improved the results by cleaning the data and fixing missing or incorrect values.

## Learning
I learned that clean and accurate data is just as important as the machine learning model itself.
